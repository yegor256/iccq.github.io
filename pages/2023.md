Sat 22 Apr 2023
<br/>
St. Petersburg, Russia

Due to the [pandemic situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic),
the conference will be held in **online** mode: all speakers will present
their work remotely over [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
{: .warning}

The Third **I**nternational **C**onference on **C**ode **Q**uality (ICCQ)
is a one-day computer science event
focused on
static and dynamic analysis,
program verification,
programming languages design,
software bug detection,
and software maintenance.
ICCQ is organized in cooperation with
[IEEE Computer Society](https://conferences.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/conferencedetails/57276).

Dr. West is the author of the famous [Object Thinking](https://amzn.to/3zm3y6U) book dedicated to the quality of object-oriented programming. He began his computing career as a programmer in 1968, the same year that software engineering became a profession. Since then, he delivered over a hundred papers and presentations at conferences including [OOPSLA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1094855.1094975) and journals including [CACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/248448.248467). He has authored [four books](http://davewest.us/books/). Today he provides mentoring, training, coaching, and consulting services.

## Keynotes and Invited Talks # {#keynotes}

**What IS Code Quality: from "ilities" to QWAN**

This talk will be a little bit of history, some philosophy, and some speculation; but, will mostly pose some questions. We will start with some historical highlights, like the "ilities," or desiderata for quality code, before moving to philosophical questions about a spectrum of code quality and the criteria that might be used to place some given code on that spectrum; and end with speculation about whether or not code can, or should, exhibit the Quality Without A Name (QWAN) of Christopher Alexander. Along the way we will share some, hopefully, amusing and illustrative stories.

Performance is a quality aspect describing how the software is performing. Any performance degradation will further affect other quality aspects, such as usability. Software developers continuously conduct testing to ensure that code addition or changes do not damage existing functionalities or negatively affect the quality. Hence, developers set strategies to detect, locate and fix the regression if needed. This paper provides an exploratory study on the challenges developers face in resolving performance regression. The study is based on the questions on a technical forum about performance regression. We collected 1828 questions discussing the regression of software execution time. All those questions are manually analyzed. The study resulted in a categorization of the challenges. We also discussed the difficulty level of performance regression issues within the developers’ community. This study provides insights to help developers during the software design and implementation to avoid regression causes.

One of the biggest expense in software development is the maintenance. Therefore, it’s critical to comprehend what triggers maintenance and if it may be predicted. Numerous research outputs have demonstrated that specific methods of assessing the complexity of created programs may produce useful prediction models to as- certain the possibility of maintenance due to software failures. As a routine it is performed prior to the release, and setting up the models frequently calls for certain, object-oriented software measurements. It’s not always the case that software developers have access to these measurements. In this paper, machine learning is ap- plied on the available data to calculate the cumulative software failure levels. A technique to forecast a soft- ware’s residual defectiveness using machine learning can be looked into as a solution to the challenge of predicting residual flaws. Software metrics and defect data were separated out of the static source code repos- itory. Static code is used to create software metrics, and reported bugs in the repository are used to gather de- fect information. By using a correlation method, metrics that had no connection to the defect data were removed. This makes it possible to analyze all the data without pausing the programming process. Large, sophisticated software’s primary issue is that it is impossible to con- trol everything manually, and the cost of an error can be quite expensive. Developers may miss errors during testing as a consequence, which will raise maintenance costs. Finding a method to accurately forecast software defects is the overall objective.

We performed a comparative analysis of code genera- tion model performance with evaluation using common NLP metrics in comparison to a test-based evaluation. The investigation was performed in the context of ques- tion answering with code (test-to-code problem) and was aimed at applicability checking both ways for gen- erated code evaluation in a fully automatic manner. We used CodeGen and GPTNeo pretrained models ap- plied to a problem of question answering using Stack Overflow-based corpus (APIzation). For test-based eval- uation, industrial test-generation solutions (Machinet, UTBot) were used for providing automatically gener- ated tests. The analysis showed that the performance evaluation based solely on NLP metrics or on tests pro- vides a rather limited assessment of generated code quality. We see the evidence that predictions with both high and low NLP metrics exist that pass and don’t pass tests. With the early results of our empirical study being discussed in this paper, we believe that the combi- nation of both approaches may increase possible ways for building, evaluating, and training code generation models.
