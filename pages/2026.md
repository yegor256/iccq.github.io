## Call for Papers # {#cfp}

<!--
Papers will be published in the _Proceedings of ICCQ_
and submitted for inclusion into
[IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
subject to meeting their scope and quality requirements;
to be indexed by
[Web of Science][WoS],
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), and others.
-->

Publishing is free of charge.

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

* Novelty: The paper presents new ideas and results and places them
appropriately within the context established by previous research.
* Importance: The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in
the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory
of the field.
* Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims,
such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical
analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.
* Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and
results clearly.

Papers will be reviewed by at least three [PC](#pc) members using
a [double-blind review][double-blind] process.

This is our [PDF version] of the CfP.
