# How to Become a Partner

ICCQ is making an attempt to put together best scientists
working in the area of code quality analysis. The event is organized
and sponsored by a few famous academic organizations in Russia, including
[Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru).

ICCQ is interested in seeing Russian academic, not-for-profit, and commercial
organizations as our partners. If you, as much as we are,
concerned about the quality of code software developers write nowadays,
please [email us](mailto:partners@iccq.ru) and will discuss
how exactly you can help us make the event even better.

This is what we expect from our partners:

  * Distribute information about ICCQ among those who
    may potentially become our speakers;

  * Suggest one person from your organization to become
    a member of our Program Committee;

  * Attend the event (you will get 4 free passes); and

  * Let us share the information about our partnership
    on this website.

Thanks for helping us!
