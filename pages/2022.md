## Keynotes and Invited Talks # {#keynotes}

**Enterprise-scale static analysis: A Pinpoint experience**

Despite years of research and practice, modern static analysis techniques still cannot detect oldest and extremely well understood software bugs such as the Heartbleed, one of the most “spectacular” security flaws of the recent decade. A remedy, as what we have attempted through the successful commercialization of the Pinpoint platform (PLDI 18), is to make static program analysis aware of the basic characteristics of the modern enterprise-scale software system. The talk focuses on discussing these characteristics and how Pinpoint addresses them pragmatically as well as its future directions. Pinpoint is a LLVM-based cross-language static analysis platform and deployed in major Chinese tech companies such as Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and Alibaba.

**To What Extent Can Code Quality be Improved by Eliminating Test Smells?**

Software testing is a key activity to guarantee software
reliability and maintainability. However, developers always ignore the maintenance of test code when performing a tradeoff between code quality and release
deadlines. Moreover, there lacks of research to quantify
the relationship between test code and production code
quality. As a result, test quality degrades due to the lack
of appropriate refactoring plans. This paper fills the
gap by evaluating to what extent can code quality be
improved by eliminating test smells. First, we detect
the presence of test smells in 119 historical releases of
10 open-source projects. Afterward, we evaluate code
quality in 2 aspects, i.e., defect- and change-proneness.
Finally, we exploit the odds ratio and Mann-Whitney
test to quantify the extent of variation for the code
quality. Results show that the OR values of the test
code and production code are both much greater than 1,
which proves that the test smell is indeed a risk factor
to increase the defect- proneness of code. Moreover,
the change-proneness of the test code and associated
production code reduces significantly after the elimination. Experiment also reveals Assertion Roulette is the
riskiest smell to degrade production code quality

Writing intuitively understandable method names is an
important aspect of good programming practice. The
method names have to summarize the codes’ behavior
such that software engineers would easily understand
their purpose. Modern automatic testing tools are able to
generate potentially unlimited number of unit tests for
a project under test. However, these tests suffers from
unintelligible unit test names as it is a quite difficult
to understand what each test triggers and checks. This
inspired us to adapt the state-of-the-art method name
prediction approaches for automatically generated unit
tests. We have developed a graph extraction pipeline
with prediction models based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). Extracted graphs contain information about the
structure of unit tests and their calling functions. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed work
outperforms other models with precision = 0.48, recall =
0.42 and F1 = 0.45 results. The dataset and source codes
are released for wide public access.

**Quasi-Dominators and Random Selection in Mutation Testing**

Mutation Testing is a powerful approach to bug detecting and assessing code quality; however, software
developers may be reluctant to embrace the technique
due to the monstrous quantity of redundant mutants it
generates. In spite of their large numbers, redundant
mutants are relatively innocuous. Recent research indicates that redundant mutants affect a test engineer’s
work effort only slightly, whereas equivalent mutants
have a direct linear impact. Moreover, the time invested
analyzing equivalent mutants produces no unit tests.
Dominator mutants seek to address the redundancy
problem, but they require the identification of all subsumption relationships, which consequently reveals all
equivalent mutants. This paper introduces the notion of
quasi-dominator mutants, which augment dominator
mutants in significant numbers, enhancing their performance, and provides new insight into why random
of mutant selection performs so well.
