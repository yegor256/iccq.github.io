\sect{Welcome from Steering Committee}

In the last few decades, software has become the dominant component of business and everyday life all over the world. Mobile devices, cloud applications, IoT, ERP, robots, and AI depend on high quality and trustworthy software. Besides the inevitable functional defects, software development faces additional challenges in the era of the Internet, such as malicious attacks, private data leaks, unstable networks, and so on.

Huawei has been valuing the trustworthiness of software for a long time and is happy to support ICCQ, the conference focused on static analysis, program verification, bug detection, and software maintenance. These research topics are very important for the quality of software and the business it works for.

It's our honor to support a new computer science conference, which enables an open dialog between researchers from all countries and origins to mitigate the above mentioned problems. We hope ICCQ can benefit all participants and have an important impact on the history of trustworthy software.
