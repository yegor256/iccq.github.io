We welcome you to the fourth International Conference on Code Quality(ICCQ'24)!

If you have been following our conference, you have likely noticed that the
quality of accepted papers has been increasing each year. We believe this is
due to the growing popularity of the event among computer scientists
and the diligent efforts of our Program Committee members in their reviews.
Every paper submitted to our conference undergoes at least three blind reviews,
and only those papers without a single suggestion for rejection are accepted.
We plan to maintain this high standard in the coming years. This year, the
acceptance rate was as low as 17\%, with only four papers accepted out of 23
submitted for review. As in previous years, our objective is not to become
large, but to focus on the quality of published papers.

We are very thankful to the 26 members of the Program Committee who participated
in the review process purely out of enthusiasm. We are especially thankful to
the ACM Fellows who joined the Program Committee this year: Philip Wadler from
the University of Edinburgh and Ranjit Jhala from the University of
California.

It was an honor for us to have Xin Xia from the SEAT Lab of Huawei as a keynote
speaker this year. We would like to express our appreciation to all authors and
strongly encourage them to return next year with their new research results.

It is important to mention that we would not be able to make ICCQ happen without
the support of our academic partners: Innopolis University, St. Petersburg
State University, and HSE University.

We also thank the IEEE Computer Society for allowing us to publish ICCQ
proceedings in their publishing system.

Finally, thank you to all attendees, and once again, welcome to ICCQ!
