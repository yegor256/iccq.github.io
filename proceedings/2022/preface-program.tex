\sect{Message from Program Committee}

Dear Speakers, Authors, Delegates, and Readers:

It is my most sincere pleasure to welcome you to the second edition of ICCQ. Whether you are physically present, virtually with us, or simply a reader of this volume, we would like to express you our deepest gratitude to take your time to analyse our work.

ICCQ is a very young conference, still it has been able to secure IEEE endorsement and to select papers with the highest rigour, where less than 30\% of the papers have been at the end coming to the final presentation.

ICCQ has been conceived from the brilliant mind of a few world recognized researchers in Programming Languages and Software Engineering and has then expanded itself featuring a wide community of members who have initially accepted to be part of the program committee.

This year ICCQ has been hosted by Innopolis University, also a very young endeavour in the Volga Valley in Tatarstan, Russia. We feel very proud for this selection and we are thankful to the organizers for that.

I do not want to bother you with additional worlds, I just wish you a very happy reading!

Sincerely,\\
Dr. Giancarlo Succi\\
Chairman of the Program Committee \\
Dean, Full Professor\\
Faculty of Computer Science and Software Engineering\\
Innopolis University, Russia
