\sect{Welcome from Steering Committee}

It is an obvious fact that software has become the dominant component of business and everyday life all over the world. Cloud applications, mobile devices, IoT, ERP, robots, and AI depend on software, which is expected to be of high quality. Besides the inevitable functional defects, software development faces additional challenges such as malicious attacks, private data leaks, unstable networks, and so on.

Huawei has been valuing the trustworthiness of software for a long time and is happy to support ICCQ once again. We know ICCQ as a conference organized with the highest possible standards. The research topics addressed at ICCQ are very important for the quality of software and the business it works for: static analysis, program verification, bug detection, and software maintenance.

It's our honor to support a young and fast-growing computer science conference, which enables an open dialog between researchers from all countries and origins to mitigate the above mentioned problems. We hope ICCQ can benefit all participants and have an important impact on academia and industry.
