# It is possible that you'll bump into some problems while setting up Ruby and Bundler,
# for example `TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` while attempting to connect
# to a server (if you're a Windows user). This happens because TZInfo needs to
# get a sourse of timezone data on your computer, but it fails. On many Unix-based
# systems (e.g. Linux), TZInfo is able to use the system zoneinfo directory
# as a source of data. However, Windows doesn't include such a directory,
# so the 'tzinfo-data' gem needs to be installed instead. The 'tzinfo-data' gem
# contains the same zoneinfo data, packaged as a set of Ruby modules.
# A solution was proposed by [Adly](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1205392/adly),
# and we added it to the Gemfile. Kindly NOT delete those two 'tzinfo' and 'tzinfo-data'
# strings to avoid this issue.
